# rAddins

Some custom RStudio [addins](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/).

Currently addins are:

 * inserting compound pipe (`%<>%`)
 * inserting library calls for tidyverse, magrittr and purrr

After installation, these can be found as options in RStudio's keyboard shortcuts (search for `addin`)
